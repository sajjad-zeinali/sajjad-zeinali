## What I’m Interested In

I’m excited to continue my journey in **numerical methods**. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of Python and apply it to solve complex problems. Learning and coding in this field is where I see myself growing!

## My Projects

- **[Collection-Of-Numerical-Methods-In-ChE](https://github.com/sajjad-zeinali/Collection-Of-Numerical-Methods-In-ChE)**  
  A collection of 10 different problems solved using Python. This project covers a variety of numerical methods and is a great showcase of practical applications!  

- **[Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE](https://github.com/sajjad-zeinali/Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE)**  
  A project focused on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with Python. It’s a work in progress, and I plan to keep adding to it over time.

- **[Telegram-Bots](https://github.com/sajjad-zeinali/Telegram-Bots)**  
  A collection of Telegram bots for chemical engineering calculations, starting with an Ideal Gas Law calculator. More bots to come!
