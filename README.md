# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Sajjad Zeinali

Iâ€™m a chemical engineering student with a passion for coding, especially in Python. I love diving into the world of programming, particularly focusing on **numerical methods** and their applications. Check out some of my work:

- [Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE](https://github.com/sajjad-zeinali/Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE)  
- [Collection-Of-Numerical-Methods-In-ChE](https://github.com/sajjad-zeinali/Collection-Of-Numerical-Methods-In-ChE)

Coding is my way of solving real-world problems, and Iâ€™m excited to keep exploring this space!

## My Skills

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries I Work With**:  
  - NumPy  
  - SciPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - SymPy  
- **Focus**: Numerical methods and scientific computing  

## What Iâ€™m Interested In

Iâ€™m excited to continue my journey in **numerical methods**. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of Python and apply it to solve complex problems. Learning and coding in this field is where I see myself growing!

## My Projects

- **[Collection-Of-Numerical-Methods-In-ChE](https://github.com/sajjad-zeinali/Collection-Of-Numerical-Methods-In-ChE)**  
  A collection of 10 different problems solved using Python. This project covers a variety of numerical methods and is a great showcase of practical applications!  

- **[Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE](https://github.com/sajjad-zeinali/Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE)**  
  A project focused on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with Python. Itâ€™s a work in progress, and I plan to keep adding to it over time.
